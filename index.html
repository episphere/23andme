<h2>Interoperation</h2>
<p>This Web application will explore the use of <a href="https://api.23andme.com/" target="_blank">23andMe's API</a> as <b>a mechanism to assess individual genomic cancer risk without moving the individue's data</b>. 
This is achieved by moving the risk calculation code to the user's device, rather that having the users genomic data leave the user's own device. 
That is, the sensitive information and prediction stays with the user, <b>the code does the travelling</b>. When ready to connect to your 23and me account click <button id="corntinueLogin" onclick="nme.ui()">Continue</button>.</p>
<h2> Cancer Research</h2>
<p>
It also hypothecized that the user-first control of the data builds the necessary trust for those wanting to contribute to cancer research with their data to do so at their discretion.
The resulting effect is that the the data contributed by those, and only those, that want to share it with researchers, is then used to fine tune <a href="https://sbu-bmi.github.io/healthBit/#" target="_blank">precision prevention models</a> tailorable for everybody.
The same user-centric architecture (REST APIs scoped by OAUTH2) can be used to aggregate additional user derived data, such as <a href="https://sbu-bmi.github.io/healthBit/#" target="_blank">wearable sensors</a>, and <a href="http://www.hl7.org/fhir/smart-app-launch/" target="_blank">Electronic Medical Reccords</a>.
Please note the exploratory nature of this tool. A more defenite use of this approach, with a potential usebase of 5 million 23andMe customers, would necessarily be pursued through <a href="https://research.23andme.com/research-innovation-collaborations/" target="_blank">23andMe Research Innovation Collaborations Program</a>.
</p>
<h2>User Engagement</h2>
<p>
It is interresting to note that this aggregation of user-controlled signals may create a particulalry compelling case for a different approach to user engagement through questionnaires that determine demographic, behavioral, environmental and familial risk factors.
For example, the same questionnarie entry where a smoking habit is reported can be used to estimate the decrease of cancer risk if the habit is dropped. To achieve this result, this tool was developed as a PWA (<a href="https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps" target="_blank">Progressive Web Applications</a>).
